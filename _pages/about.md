Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Management and Strategy at The University of Hong Kong. I am on the 2024-2025 job market.

My research interest focuses on media economics, digital economy, managerial economics and applied microeconomics.  I leverage empirical frameworks and big data techniques to investigate the impact of media on government and corporate accountability, with a particular focus on emerging markets. More broadly, I am interested in understanding the interactions among the government, business, and the public in the digital age.
