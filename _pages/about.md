Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Management and Strategy at The University of Hong Kong. I am on the 2024-2025 job market.

My research interest focuses on media economics, digital economics, and corporate non-market strategy. I employ big-data technology and large-scale textual analyses to study the impact of media and other digital platforms on government and corporate accountability.
