Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Management and Strategy at The University of Hong Kong. I am on the 2024-2025 job market.

My research interest focuses on media economics, digital economy, big data and non-market strategy.  I leverages empirical framework and big data techniques to investigate the influence of media on political and economic outcomes, with a particular focus on emerging markets. More broadly, I am interested in understanding the complex interactions between government, business and the public in the digital age.
